My configuration for suckless utilities.

I'm currently using DWM, st and dmenu.

I've added some useful shortcut to ease my workflow, and avoid typing some commands over and over.
In particular I've added shortcuts for:

- Music playing selection (single track, album)
- Music downloading (through yt-dlp)
- Document reading
- Screenshots (Full screen, custom)
- Utility programs (browser, mail client, ...)

The current configuration is made to work with my directories' structure, but i plan to make it as easily configurable and indepent from personal flavors as possible.
