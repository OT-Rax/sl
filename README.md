My configuration for suckless utilities.

I'm currently using DWM, st and dmenu.

I've added some useful shortcut to ease my workflow, and, of league, avoid typing some commands over and over.
In particular I've added shortcuts for:

- Music playing selection (though mpv, listen to single track or album)
- Music downloading (through yt-dlp)
- Youtube streaming with search query (through mpv and yt-dlp)
- Audio control (through pactl)
- Document reading (currently through mupdf)
- Screenshots (through flameshot, full screen, custom)
- Utility programs (browser, mail client, ...)

The current configuration is made to work with my directories' structure, but I plan to make it as easily configurable and independent from personal flavors as possible.
